# Storybook

This repo will act as a design system of Components that I have built while learning how to use React.js, and as a place to hack and learn about Storybook.

## Components/Packages Used

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react/)

## Inspiration

## Installation and Use

1. Clone the repo - `https://github.com/benAkehurst/react-component-library.git`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run storybook`

This will launch the storybook instance. Happy hacking.

## Tests

Components have tests run using enzyme and jest. These can be run using the command:
`npm run test`
